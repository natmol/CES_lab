# CES_lab
Parking distance project 

# Requirements: 

0. Implementation on arduino One 

1. measure the distance  continually with an ultra sonic sensor HCSR04
    1.1 It should on the floor so detect from 0 to 1 meter distance
    1.2 The signal get in an analog port and should activate a interruption when ?
2. Beeper signal to show the distance as frequency 
    2.1 use of PMW signal to modify the frequency of the beeper
3. Battery 2AA
3.1 Integrate power save energy: Probably with software

Hardware:

1. Arduino uno
2. Breadboard
3. Active bozer
4. HC-SR04
5. WIRES
6. 2 BATERY 2AA
7. CASE FOR BATTERY (CABLE WITH PLUG)

ADDITIONAL
 Multimeter
